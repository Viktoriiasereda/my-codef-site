# ABOUT US

The Neurodivergent Society was founded this year as part of an effort to:

* Improve QM services for neurodivergent individuals
* Create a safe space for neurodivergents
* Educate the local community on neurodivergence

## WHY JOIN US?
We offer a range of events including sensory socials, opportunities to learn about neurodivergence and networking events with neurodivergent professionals. The events are open to everyone and we encourage neurotypicals to explore and learn more about how to support neurodivergents.
